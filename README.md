# TaskScheduler

A Task Scheduler is a system that manages and executes tasks based on their priority levels. In 
this context, a task refers to a unit of work that needs to be executed, and each task is associated 
with a priority value. The priority queue and min-heap are data structures that help efficiently 
organize and retrieve tasks based on their priorities.

Priority Queue with Min-Heap: The priority queue is implemented using a min-heap data 
structure. A min-heap is a binary tree where the value of each node is less than or equal to the 
values of its children, ensuring that the smallest element (highest priority in this context) is at 
the root of the heap.
